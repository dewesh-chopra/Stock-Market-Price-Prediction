# Stock Trend Analysis with Stacked LSTM

(Deployed on: [https://stock-analysis-by-dewesh.streamlit.app/])

## Overview
This project was developed during my trainee internship with Sai Coding Solutions Pvt. Ltd., where I had the opportunity to create a powerful Stock Trend Analysis tool. Leveraging Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, this model provides a stock trend prediction.

## Key Features
- **LSTM Models:** We have implemented Stacked LSTM networks for precise time series prediction.
- **Yahoo Finance:** We have used Yahoo finance to get the stock data (import yfinance as yf).
- **Interactive Dashboard:** The project is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly and interactive interface.
- **Historical Data:** Utilize historical stock market data for training and testing the model.
- **Real-time Updates:** The model can be updated with the latest data for up-to-the-minute trend analysis.
- **Visualization:** Visualize stock price predictions and historical data trends through interactive charts and graphs.
- **Certificate:** This project was developed as part of my trainee internship, and I have a certificate from Sai Coding Solution Pvt. Ltd. to validate my contributions.
